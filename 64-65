This off-season, I will practice with at least 1 champ from each class, with the aim of using champs that 
I haven't used in the main season. I will try to take at least 6 fights, but the more the better.

- Spider 2099
- Scorpion

2. Mystic
- Spider Pavitr
- SS

3. Tech
- Guardian
- Ultron

4. Mutant
- Prof. X
- Stryfe

-Dani node 13 = Pavitr. nothing special but I get hit.
