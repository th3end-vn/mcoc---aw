This off-season, I will practice with at 
least 1 champ from each class, with the aim 
of using champs that 
I haven't used in the main season. I will try 
to take at least 6 fights, but the more the 
better.

1. Science
- Spider 2099
- Scorpion

2. Mystic
- Spider Pavitr
- SS

3. Tech
- Guardian
- Ultron

4. Mutant
- Prof. X
- Stryfe

5. Skill
- Okoye
- Valkyrie

6. Cosmic
- Corvus
- Dean

War 1 - Spider Pavitr, Mole, Avenom
-Dumb mistake, it should have been hood not 
Avenom
-Knull 4 = Pavitr. okay but not very ideal. 
I get hit a few times
-Dani 13 = Pavitr. nothing special but I get 
hit.
-Rintrah 23 = Avenom, kinda slow, lost a bit
of HP because of blocking
-Thanos 32 = Pavitr dies because failed to
intercept many times, Mole do the rest lost
20% HP
-HE 43 = Mole pretty good but lost 50% HP
-Nefaria 46 = Mole, unlucky because he throws
sp1 to block 2 times, but managable
-Nick 48 = Mole not bad, lost 10% HP?
-Boss Ons = Avenom, average, get hit a few
times, get parried later so no WP. should have
baited more sp2 than sp1, the healing from the
magnetisim debuff doesn't worth it.

War 2 - Avenom, Spider 2099, Tigra
